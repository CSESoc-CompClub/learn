AI is taking over! There are claims that it's stealing our jobs and our information. But did you know it's definitely consuming a large share of our energy resources? As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, its growing energy needs are exposing some unexpected costs.

Training just one AI model can consume thousands of megawatt hours of electricity and emit hundreds of tons of carbon. Cooling data centers for this process also leads to significant evaporation of fresh water into the atmosphere. This increases pressure on the already limited freshwater resources.

An AI query can consume up to ten times more electricity than a typical Google search. With millions of requests made every day, that energy use adds up quickly. Data centres already consume between 1% and 1.5% of the world's electricity. Existing power grids, many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels, are under increasing pressure due to this growing demand for AI. By 2030, AI is projected to drive a 160% increase in data centre energy consumption.

Every time we send an AI request, weâ€™re adding to this rising demand. While privacy and security are major concerns, we also need to consider the environmental impact of AI and push for sustainable development and responsible use of AI. So, next time you make a query, remember it comes with an environment cost!
