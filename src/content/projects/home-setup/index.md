## What is this all about?
If you've ever wanted to take the plunge into programming, or have programmed before; albeit on pre-setup environment (maybe during our workshops? ðŸ‘€), it's definitely a good idea to have your own setup! This way, whenever you get that itch to code you're all ready to get started :)c

I would like to preface that this guide aims to *introduce* you to the tools that you may need but won't go into the step-by-step specifics. I'm at least 99% sure there are better guides out there to get into the specific steps to install or configure something, and will be linking the relevant ones.
